# StairLighting
---
# Why?
  - Idea - https://www.reddit.com/r/homeautomation/comments/r3qbqt/my_stairs_to_the_first_floor_now_use_3_ip/
  - Automatically Light the way when walking up or down the stairs
  - Stairs were being rebuilt so I had access to the back of them for wiring
  -  

# What?
  - Parts - 
  - ESP32
  - DC/DC Converter 24v to 5
  - Palitix COB LED Strip
  - Mostfet
  - Level Shifter
  - Wire
  - ToF Senssor 

# How it should work
  - When you approche under tread lighting should turn on
  - Controll the brightness
  - Controll the dimming 
  - Do they all come on?
  - How long until all stairs are on?
  - Off Time, so they don't come on
  - Always on 
  - Connect to a wall switch?
  - Controll the color
